# About

Hello, I'm a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer & Information Sciences at the University of Delaware, where I'm advised by [Dr. Xu Yuan](https://people.cmix.louisiana.edu/yuan/index.html). I earned my Bachelor's degree from Shandong University, China in 2016. Before pursuing my graduate studies, I spent four years in the industry developing Cloud Computing and Internet of Things (IoT) applications. I began my graduate studies in 2021 and received my Master's degree from the University of Louisiana at Lafayette in 2023. I then transferred to the University of Delaware to continue my Ph.D. research. My research interest focuses on Trustworthy AI (e.g., Explainable AI), AI Fairness (e.g., Long-tailed Recognition), and AI for Science.
