Hello, I am a Ph.D. student in the School of Computing and Informatics at University of Louisiana at Lafayette, supervised by [Dr. Xu Yuan](https://people.cmix.louisiana.edu/yuan/index.html). I received my bachelor's degree from Shandong University, China, in 2016. My research focuses on the theory and applications of Deep Learning (DL), including DL security, DL in long-tailed recognization, and DL for climate change.
